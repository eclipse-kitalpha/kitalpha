# Contributing to Polarsys Kitalpha

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

 Kitalpha is an environment to develop and execute MBE (Model-Based 
 Engineering) workbenches for description of systems in system, software 
 and hardware engineering. Kitalpha provides both development and runtime 
 services to define, use and manage architecture frameworks and viewpoints.
 
 Kitalpha is dedicated to implement modelling frameworks and viewpoints, 
 and this in coherence with the ISO/IEC 42010 standard for description 
 of system architecture. In this standard, an architecture framework 
 aggregates viewpoints. Each viewpoint describes at least one system 
 concern, such as non-functional concerns (e.g., performance, safety, 
 security, and cost), for involved stakeholders (e.g., safety engineer). 
 Kitalpha extends the definition of viewpoint to also consider it as an 
 engineering extension which comes with its own metamodels, representations 
 (e.g., diagrams, tables, user interfaces), rules (e.g., validation, 
 analysis, transformation), services and tools to address an engineering 
 specialty. Consequently, an MBE workbench is the result of a flexible 
 assembly of core viewpoints extended by new ones which are, in the context 
 of co-engineering, appropriate and valuable for specialty engineers. 
 The set of all the viewpoints provide a solution for the complete description 
 of a system.
